    """Persist replaced links and their statuses.

    This helper updates the ``process_threads`` mapping with the provided
    ``link_statuses`` for ``host`` and stores both the updated mapping and the
    status cache using ``user_manager``.  The provided ``save_process_threads``
    callback is invoked to write the modified ``process_threads`` structure to
    disk using the application's existing persistence logic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    process_threads:
        The current process threads mapping.
    category:
        Category name of the thread row being updated.
    thread_title:
        Title of the thread row being updated.
    host:
        Host for which the direct links belong.
    link_statuses:
        Mapping of direct link URLs to their last known status.
    save_process_threads:
        Callback that persists ``process_threads`` to disk.
    user_manager:
        Object providing ``load_user_data`` and ``save_user_data`` methods for
        per-user storage.
    status_filename:
        Filename used for the link-status cache. Defaults to ``link_status.json``.

    Returns
    -------
    Dict
        The updated link-status cache.
